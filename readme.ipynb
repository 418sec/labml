    "# [üöß Lab 3.0](https://github.com/vpj/lab)\n",
    "\n",
    "**‚ö†Ô∏è This is the development version, with a lot of frequent bareaking changes.**\n",
    "Feel free to try it out.\n",
    "Use the [previous](https://github.com/vpj/lab/tree/2.0) stable version if you want to use it in a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "This library helps you organize machine learning experiments.\n",
    "It is a quite small library,\n",
    " and most of the modules can be used independently of each other.\n",
    "This doesn't have any user interface.\n",
    "Experiment results are maintained in a folder structure,\n",
    "and there is a Python API to access them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Organize Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintains logs, summaries and checkpoints of all the experiment runs in a folder structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "logs\n",
    "‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ experiment1\n",
    "‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run1\n",
    "‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run.yaml\n",
    "‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ configs.yaml\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### [üéõ Dashboard](https://github.com/vpj/lab_dashboard) to browse experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "The web dashboard helps navigate experiments and multiple runs.\n",
    "You can checkout the configs and a summary of performance.\n",
    "You can launch TensorBoard directly from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, we want to let you edit configs and run new experiments and analyse\n",
    "outputs on the dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logger\n",
    "\n",
    "Logger has a simple API to produce pretty console outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"/images/loop.gif\" /></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Manage configurations and hyper-parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "You can setup configs/hyper-parameters with functions.\n",
    "[üß™lab](https://github.com/vpj/lab) would identify the dependencies and run \n",
    "them in topological order.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@Configs.calc()\n",
    "def model(c: Configs):\n",
    "    return Net().to(c.device)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can setup multiple options for configuration functions. \n",
    "So you don't have to write a bunch if statements to handle configs.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@Configs.calc('optimizer')\n",
    "def sgd(c: Configs):\n",
    "    return optim.SGD(c.model.parameters(), lr=c.learning_rate, momentum=c.momentum)\n",
    "\n",
    "@Configs.calc('optimizer')\n",
    "def adam(c: Configs):\n",
    "    return optim.Adam(c.model.parameters())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install it via `pip` directly from github.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -e git+git@github.com:vpj/lab.git#egg=lab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create a `.lab.yaml` file.\n",
    "An empty file at the root of the project should\n",
    "be enough. You can set project level configs for\n",
    " 'check_repo_dirty' and 'path'\n",
    "in the config file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lab will store all experiment data in folder `logs/` \n",
    "relative to `.lab.yaml` file.\n",
    "If `path` is set in `.lab.yaml` then it will be stored in `[path]logs/`\n",
    " relative to `.lab.yaml` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need the `.lab.yaml` file if you only plan on using the logger.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Samples\n",
    "\n",
    "[samples folder](https://github.com/vpj/lab/tree/master/samples) contains a\n",
    " bunch of examples of using üß™ lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logger\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from lab import logger\n",
    "from lab.logger.colors import Text, Color\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Logging with colors\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "logger.log(\"Red\", color=Text.danger)\n",
    "logger.log([\n",
    "    ('Red', Color.red),\n",
    "    'Normal',\n",
    "    ('Cyan', Color.cyan)\n",
    "])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Logging debug info\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "logger.info(a=2, b=1)\n",
    "logger.info(dict(name='Name', price=22))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Log indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you specify indicators and the logger stores them temporarily and write in batches.\n",
    "It can aggregate and write them as means or histograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(1, N):\n",
    "    logger.add_global_step()\n",
    "    loss = train()\n",
    "    logger.store(loss=loss)\n",
    "    if i % 10 == 0:\n",
    "        logger.write()\n",
    "    if i % 1000 == 0:\n",
    "        logger.new_line()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This stores all the loss values and writes the logs the mean on every tenth iteration.\n",
    "Console output line is replaced until `new_line` is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Indicator settings\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "add_indicator(name: str,\n",
    "              type_: IndicatorType = IndicatorType.scalar,\n",
    "              options: IndicatorOptions = None)\n",
    "\n",
    "class IndicatorType(Enum):\n",
    "    queue = 'queue'\n",
    "    histogram = 'histogram'\n",
    "    scalar = 'scalar'\n",
    "    pair = 'pair'\n",
    "\n",
    "class IndicatorOptions(NamedTuple):\n",
    "    is_print: bool = False\n",
    "    queue_size: int = 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify details of an indicator using `add_indicator`.\n",
    "If this is not called like the example above, it assumes a `scalar`\n",
    " with `is_print=True`.\n",
    " \n",
    "`histogram` indicators will log a histogram of data.\n",
    "`queue` will store data in a `deque` of size `queue_size`, and log histograms.\n",
    "Both of these will log the means too. And if `is_print` is `True` it will print the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pair` is still under development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sections\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with logger.section(\"Load data\"):\n",
    "    # code to load data\n",
    "with logger.section(\"Create model\"):\n",
    "    # code to create model\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sections let you monitor time taken for\n",
    "different tasks and also helps *keep the code clean*\n",
    "by separating different blocks of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Progress\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with logger.section(\"train\", total_steps=100):\n",
    "    for i in range(100):\n",
    "        # Multiple training steps in the inner loop\n",
    "        logger.progress(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows the progress for code within the section.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Iterator and Enumerator\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for data, target in logger.iterator(\"Test\", test_loader):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "for i, (data, target) in logger.enumerator(\"Train\", train_loader):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This combines `section` and `progress`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for step in logger.loop(range(0, total_steps)):\n",
    "\t# training code ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `loop` keeps track of the time taken and time remaining for the loop.\n",
    "You can use *sections*, *iterators* and *enumerators* within loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "exp = Experiment(name=\"mnist_pytorch\",\n",
    "                 comment=\"Test\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `name`: Name of the experiment;\n",
    " If not provided, this defaults to the calling python filename\n",
    "* `comment`: Comment about the current experiment run\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Starting an expriemnt\n",
    "```python\n",
    "exp.start()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This does the initialization work like creating log folders, writing run details, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "exp.start(run_index=-1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This starts the experiment from where it was left in the last run.\n",
    "You can provide a specific the run index to start from.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Save Checkpoint\n",
    "```python\n",
    "logger.save_checkpoint()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This saves a checkpoint and you can start from the saved checkpoint with\n",
    "`exp.start(run=-1)`.\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "I was coding existing reinforcement learning algorithms\n",
    " to play Atari games for fun.\n",
    "It was not easy to keep track of things when I started\n",
    " trying variations, fixing bugs etc.\n",
    "Then I wrote some tools to organize my experiment runs.\n",
    "I found it important to keep track of git commits\n",
    "to make sure I can reproduce results.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also wrote a logger to display pretty results on screen and\n",
    " to make it easy to write TensorBoard summaries.\n",
    "It also keeps track of training times which makes it easy to spot\n",
    " what's taking up most resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "This library is was made by combining these bunch of tools.\n",
