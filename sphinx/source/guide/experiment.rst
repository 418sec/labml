Experiment
==========

Lab will keep track of experiments if you declare an Experiment. It will
keep track of logs, code diffs, git commits, etc.

.. code-block:: python

    from lab.experiment.pytorch import Experiment

The ``name`` of the defaults to the calling python filename. However
when invoking from a Jupyter Notebook it must be provided because the
library cannot find the calling file name. ``comment`` can be changed
later from the `Dashboard <https://github.com/vpj/lab_dashboard>`__.

.. code-block:: python

    exp = Experiment(name="mnist_pytorch",
                     comment="Test")

Starting an experiments creates folders, stores the experiment meta
data, git commits, and source diffs.

.. code-block:: python

    exp.start()



.. raw:: html

    <pre><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">mnist_pytorch</span></strong>: <span style="color: #208FFB">3827c50885f211ea9b98acde48001122</span>
    	<strong><span style="color: #DDB62B">Test</span></strong>
    	[dirty]: <strong><span style="color: #DDB62B">"ðŸ“š log indicators generated"</span></strong></pre>


You can also start from a previously saved checkpoint.

.. code:: python

   exp.start(run_uuid='XXX')
